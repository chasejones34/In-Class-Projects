 *  Description: The indegree of a vertex in a digraph is the number of directed
 *  edges that point to that vertex. The outdegree of a vertex in a digraph is
 *  the number of directed edges that emanate from that vertex. No vertex is
 *  reachable from a vertex of outdegree 0, which is called a sink; a vertex of
 *  indegree 0, which is called a source, is not reachable from an other vertex.
 *  A digraph where self-loops are allowed and every vertex has outdegree
 *  is called a map (a function from the set of integers from 0 to Vâ€“1 onto
 *  itself). Write a program Degrees.java that implements the following API:
 *
